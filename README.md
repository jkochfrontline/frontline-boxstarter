frontline-boxstarter
====================

This repository holds the [boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/) configuration used for [Frontline Techonlogies](http://www.frontlinetechnologies.com/) to setup my windows dev machine.  It installs various programs I find helpful for development.

## Usage
Set Internet Explorer as your default browser (sigh)...

Open a command prompt or powershell terminal as an administrative user

Paste in the following:

    START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?

Hit "Enter" and go grab a coffee :)

Be sure to reset your default browser when finished.
